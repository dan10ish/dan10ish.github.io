I can't function properly with a cluttered setup of the devices I use daily. Mind you I am not talking about minimal setups, I am talking about cluttered setups. I need to know where I can find all my files and projects in any device I use daily. Let me show you how I setup my devices so they dont ruin my life.

## macOS: Welcome, Now Let Me Fix You

- **Setup Wizard Choices That Actually Matter**
  - Migration Assistant? No, I like starting fresh
  - Creating a simple user account with account name matching the full name : `danish` with lowercase `d`
  - FileVault: Yes, encrypt everything
  - Dont share anything with apple, no analytics, no audio recordings, no map data.
  - Setup 3 touch IDs, twice of right hand index finger (for increases accuracy) and once of left hand index finger.

- **System Settings (atleast the important ones)**
  - Default Monterey wallpaper (dark still)
  - Appearance
    - Click on the scroll bar to: Jump to spot that's clicked
  - Desktop and Dock
    - Click wallpaper to reveal desktop: Only in stage manager
  - Displays
    - More space
  - Internet accounts
    - Add the google accounts and work accounts
  - Keyboard
    - Edit input sources: Toggle off predictive texts and text replacement.

- **🚫 Killing the Bloat**
  - Removing stock apps (or just hiding them like secrets)

  - Disabling Siri (when was the last time you used siri) and Spotlight suggestions (use [raycast](https://www.raycast.com) instead).
  - System Preferences > Notifications – a silent revolution (toggle **OFF** everything)

- **🛠 Terminal Time: The Real Setup Begins**
  - Installing Homebrew please
  - Aliases, shell configs, and my [dotfile](https://github.com/dan10ish/dotfiles) rituals

- **🧰 Must-Have Apps (No Fluff)**
  - Safari and chrome. 
  - Code editor: [Zed](https://zed.dev) and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com)
  - Terminal: [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org)
  - Window tiler: [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com)
  - Other stuff: [Stats](https://mac-stats.com), [Hazeover](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/hazeover-distraction-dimmer/id430798174?mt=12)

- **🧼 Final Polish**
  - Menu bar pruning
  - Backups: Local hard drive backups regularly

## 🍏 iOS: From Hello to Hello Again

- **📱 Setup Screen Shenanigans**
  - Choosing the right language (even if you only speak “Low Power Mode”)
  - Quick Start vs Manual Setup – why I always go manual
  - Wi-Fi selection: avoiding “Mom’s iPhone Hotspot”

- **🔐 Apple ID or Apple Nope**
  - Signing in without selling your soul (or enabling every iCloud toggle)
  - Which iCloud services I actually use

- **🧠 Privacy, Please**
  - Location Services: Yes, but not *every* app
  - Analytics & Siri – who needs to know what?
  - Tracking toggle: off like it’s on fire

- **⚙️ Core Settings Tweaks**
  - Disabling Background App Refresh (aka: stealth battery killer)
  - Notification clean-up: muting the noise
  - App Limits – because discipline is a feature now

- **📦 App Store Essentials (and Exiles)**
  - What gets installed immediately
  - What never makes the cut (sorry Facebook)

- **🔋 Battery Life Zen Mode**
  - Dark mode always
  - Auto-brightness: off, manual slider gang
  - Low Power Mode shortcut – one tap to peace
