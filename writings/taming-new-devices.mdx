> Minimal setup, maximum control. Everything I need, nothing I don’t.

## macOS: Welcome, Now Let Me Fix You

This is how I set up a fresh macOS install — efficient, secure, and stripped of anything unnecessary.

### Setup Wizard: Only What Matters

- No Migration Assistant – I prefer starting from scratch, not dragging over legacy issues.
- User Account – Created as `danish` (lowercase), matching the full name.
- FileVault – Enabled. Full disk encryption is non-negotiable.
- Analytics and Tracking – All turned off. No Siri, no audio recordings, no map data shared.
- Touch ID – Three fingerprints: Right index finger twice and left index finger once.

### System Settings: The Important Ones

- Wallpaper – Default macOS Monterey (Dark mode).
- Appearance – Scrollbar behavior set to *Jump to the spot that’s clicked*.
- Desktop & Dock – Click wallpaper to show desktop: *Only when using Stage Manager*.
- Displays – Scaling set to *More Space*.
- Internet Accounts – Connected Google and work accounts only.
- Keyboard – Input sources edited to disable predictive text and text replacement.

> Most default setting choices are a joke by apple, I swear.

### Removing the Bloat

- Stock Apps – Hidden or removed as much as possible.
- Siri – Disabled entirely.
- Spotlight Suggestions – Turned off. Using [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) instead.
- Notifications – All system and app notifications disabled from System Settings.

### Terminal Setup

- Homebrew – Installed immediately.
- Dotfiles – Pulled from [my repository](https://github.com/dan10ish/dotfiles) and applied.
- Shell Config – Custom aliases and settings loaded to match my workflow.

### Essential Apps Only

- Browsers – Safari (default) and Chrome (fallback).
- Code Editors – [Zed](https://zed.dev) and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com).
- Terminal – [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) for a fast, GPU-accelerated experience.
- Window Management – [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com).
- Utilities – [Stats](https://mac-stats.com), [HazeOver](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/hazeover-distraction-dimmer/id430798174?mt=12).
- Dev: [Unity](https://unity.com), [Blender](https://www.blender.org), [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/in/products/fusion-360/overview)

### Final Steps

- Menu Bar – Cleaned up. Only essential indicators remain.
- Backups – Local, frequent, and manual via external hard drive.
