# Neural Networks

Neural networks, inspired by the human brain, are a set of algorithms that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling, and clustering of raw input.

## What is a Neural Network?

A neural network consists of:

1. **Input Layer**: Takes the initial data.
2. **Hidden Layers**: Processes data and extracts features.
3. **Output Layer**: Provides the final output.

### Basic Neural Network Structure

```plaintext
Input Layer -> Hidden Layer -> Output Layer
```

### How Neural Networks Learn

Neural networks learn using a method called **backpropagation**, where they adjust the weights of connections based on the error of the output. The goal is to minimize this error through a process called **gradient descent**.

### A Simple Example in Python

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the activation function
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Initialize weights randomly
weights = np.random.rand(2, 1)

# Input data
inputs = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]])

# Output data
outputs = np.array([[0], [1], [1], [0]])

# Simple forward pass
layer1 = np.dot(inputs, weights)
layer1_output = sigmoid(layer1)
print(layer1_output)
```

### Applications of Neural Networks

- **Image Recognition**: Used in identifying objects and faces.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding and generating human language.
- **Robotics**: Helping robots to see and navigate.
