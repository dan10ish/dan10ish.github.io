This is my first microblog. A space for quick thoughts, notes, and ideas.

## Math with LaTeX

The quadratic formula is given by:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

Euler's identity $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$ connects five fundamental constants.

## Code

Here's a simple Python snippet:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

print(fibonacci(10))
```

And some JavaScript:

```javascript
const debounce = (fn, ms) => {
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), ms);
  };
};
```

That's it for now. More to come.
