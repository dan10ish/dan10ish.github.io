The attention mechanism is the core of the transformer architecture. At its heart, it's a weighted sum where the weights are determined by the similarity between queries and keys.

## Scaled Dot-Product Attention

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

The scaling factor $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}}$ prevents the dot products from growing too large, which would push the softmax into regions with extremely small gradients.

## Multi-Head Attention

Instead of a single attention function, we project queries, keys, and values $h$ times:

$$
\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \ldots, \text{head}_h)W^O
$$

where each head is:

$$
\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
$$

## Why It Works

1. **Parallelization** — Unlike RNNs, all positions can attend to all other positions simultaneously
2. **Long-range dependencies** — Direct connections between any two positions, regardless of distance
3. **Interpretability** — Attention weights can reveal what the model "focuses on"

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V, mask=None):
    d_k = Q.size(-1)
    scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1)) / d_k**0.5
    if mask is not None:
        scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, float('-inf'))
    weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
    return torch.matmul(weights, V)
```

The simplicity of this formulation is what makes it so powerful.
